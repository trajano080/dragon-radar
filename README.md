# dragon-radar
Dragon Ball themed Android game. The player has to look for "dragon balls" (oranges could be used instead) using a radar displayed on the app, which shows the Dragon Balls' position relative to the player. Once they find one, they can aim the phone's camera at it to confirm that they have indeed found one. The player wins once they find all balls.
